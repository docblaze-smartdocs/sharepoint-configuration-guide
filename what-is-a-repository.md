A SmartDocs repository is used to store reusable content (e.g., variables, snippets, and conditional tags) for a team of SmartDocs users. A SmartDocs repository resides in a SharePoint site and consists of the SharePoint lists and libraries described below.

## Example Scenario

Let's assume our company has two teams of writers using SmartDocs:

* Sales writers are using SmartDocs to create sales proposals.

* Technical writers are using SmartDocs to create and maintain technical documentation.

In this scenario, we have set-up three SmartDocs repositories:

* The Corporate repository contains corporate-level reusable content and is accessible by all of our SmartDocs users.

* The Sales Proposals repository is dedicated to our sales writers so they can reuse content to create new sales proposals.

* The Technical Publications repository is managed by our technical writers for their technical documentation, but we also grant read access to our sales writers so they can leverage some of this content (such as product descriptions) in their sales proposals.
